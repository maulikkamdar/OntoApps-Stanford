# OntoApps-Stanford
An umbrella platform for all my Biomedical Web applications

This is the codebase for all my Biomedical Web applications, that can be directly deployed using a Python Flask container. 

This umbrella platform is deployed online at http://onto-apps.stanford.edu/

Due to file size limits, I have not uploaded the Data folder, that contains the rendered graph for both OntoReuse and PHLeGrA for querying. Please email maulikrk@stanford.edu and I will share a zipped version of the data folder. You can then unzip it under "static/data" folder.

To deploy the platform locally, just run python app.py and the application should be online at 127.0.0.1:8080
